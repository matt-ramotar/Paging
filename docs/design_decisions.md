## RealPager
- Support initial state (e.g., hardcoded)



# Technical Design Document: Advanced Paging Solution

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the design of an advanced paging solution for efficient data loading and presentation in applications. The system is designed to handle large datasets, provide smooth scrolling experiences, and offer flexibility for various data sources and presentation needs.

## 2. Core Components

### 2.1 Pager
The central component that orchestrates the paging process. It manages the overall state and coordinates between other components.

### 2.2 PagingStateManager
Manages the current state of paged data, including loaded items and loading status.

### 2.3 QueueManager
Handles the queueing of load requests, managing both append and prepend operations.

### 2.4 LoadingHandler
Responsible for executing load operations, applying middleware, and updating the paging state.

### 2.5 OperationApplier
Applies transformations to loaded data before presentation.

### 2.6 NormalizedStore
Provides an interface for data storage and retrieval, supporting both in-memory caching and persistent storage.

## 3. Key Design Decisions

### 3.1 Separation of Concerns
- Each component has a specific responsibility, promoting modularity and ease of maintenance.
- Clear interfaces between components allow for easy testing and potential replacement of implementations.

### 3.2 Reactive Design
- Use of Kotlin Flows for reactive data streaming.
- State management through StateFlow for consistent and efficient updates.

### 3.3 Configurability
- Extensive use of generics to support various data types.
- Configuration options (PagingConfig) to customize behavior.

### 3.4 Thread Safety
- Use of mutex and thread-safe data structures to ensure correct behavior in multi-threaded environments.

### 3.5 Performance Optimizations
- In-memory caching to reduce database/network access.
- Lazy loading of data through paging.
- Efficient data transformations through OperationApplier.

### 3.6 Flexibility in Data Sources
- Abstract NormalizedStore interface allows for various backend implementations (e.g., database, network, in-memory).

### 3.7 Middleware Support
- Chainable middleware for customizing load parameter processing.
- Allows for logging, modifying requests, caching strategies, etc.

### 3.8 Error Handling
- Configurable error handling strategies.
- Clear error states in PagingState for UI feedback.

### 3.9 Bi-directional Paging
- Support for both append (forward) and prepend (backward) paging.

### 3.10 Dynamic Operation Application
- Ability to add/remove/modify operations at runtime.
- Efficient caching of operation results.

## 4. Data Flow

1. UI requests data through Pager.
2. Pager coordinates with QueueManager to enqueue the request.
3. LoadingHandler processes the queue, applying middleware.
4. Data is fetched from NormalizedStore.
5. OperationApplier transforms the data.
6. PagingStateManager is updated with new data.
7. UI observes changes in PagingState and updates accordingly.

## 5. Considerations and Trade-offs

### 5.1 Memory vs. Performance
- Caching improves performance but increases memory usage.
- Configurable cache sizes and eviction policies can help balance this trade-off.

### 5.2 Complexity vs. Flexibility
- The modular design increases complexity but provides great flexibility.
- Clear documentation and examples are crucial for ease of use.

### 5.3 Eager vs. Lazy Loading
- The system supports both approaches, allowing users to choose based on their needs.

### 5.4 Consistency vs. Real-time Updates
- The system prioritizes consistency of paged data.
- Real-time updates can be supported through additional mechanisms if needed.

## 6. Future Considerations

### 6.1 Kotlin Multiplatform Support
- The design should be adaptable to Kotlin Multiplatform with minimal changes.

### 6.2 Customizable Placeholders
- Enhance placeholder support for better loading UI experiences.

### 6.3 Advanced Prefetching Strategies
- Implement more sophisticated prefetching based on user scroll behavior.

### 6.4 Integration with Popular UI Frameworks
- Provide ready-to-use integrations for common UI frameworks (e.g., Jetpack Compose, SwiftUI).

### 6.5 Monitoring and Analytics
- Add built-in support for monitoring paging performance and user interaction patterns.

## 7. Conclusion

This paging solution provides a robust, flexible, and efficient system for handling large datasets in modern applications. Its modular design, focus on performance, and extensive configurability make it suitable for a wide range of use cases while providing room for future enhancements and optimizations.
